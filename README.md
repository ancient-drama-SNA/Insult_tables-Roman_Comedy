# Roman Comedy â€” Insult Interactions

Data on insult interactions among characters from the plays of Plautus and Terence. Collated
by hand, and (currently) put into CSV format.


## Notes on my 'Insult Tables'

* As currently set up, the tables have a 5-line header, which contains metadata.
    - If converted to e.g. JSON or some other format, this header and metadata needs to be
      stripped.
* For conversion, the `csvtojson` command-line tool seems to work well.
    - A `node` program.
    - BUT: only works if the header/metadata is removed.
